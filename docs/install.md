# Install

You can install this library with ``pip``:

```bash
pip install sparse
```

You can also install from source from GitHub, either by pip installing
directly::
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pydata/sparse
```
Or by cloning the repository and installing locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pydata/sparse.git
cd sparse/
pip install .
```
Note that this library is under active development and so some API churn should
be expected.
